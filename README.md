# Online Event Planning System

Developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming module in 2nd year 1st semester, this web application was designed to streamline event management processes.

I was responsible for implementing the Payment Management functionality, including full CRUD operations for handling payment records. Additionally, I developed the user login and validation system to ensure secure admin access.

Technologies used: Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL.
